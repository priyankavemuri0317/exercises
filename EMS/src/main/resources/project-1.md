# Project One

For Project One, you are required to build a REST API that satisifies the requirements set forth in the Expense
Reimbursement Management System document. Your ERMS must abide by following:

## Technology

## Other

* Complete approval process
* Discrete Data Access layer
* At least 90% test coverage (line coverage) for the data and service layers

You will have 5 minutes to demo this to me and the rest of the cohort.
